## 🤖 AUTONOMY LEVELS

### Rydon V4: Semi-Autonomous
```
Revanth: "Add a ride history feature"
         ↓
Claude.ai: Plans the feature, creates prompt
         ↓
Revanth: Copies prompt to Claude Code
         ↓
Claude Code: Implements
         ↓
Revanth: Tests and reports back
         ↓
Claude.ai: Next prompt
         ↓
Revanth: Copies to Claude Code again
         ↓
Repeat...

Decision makers: You + Claude.ai
Implementer: Claude Code
Bottleneck: You (copying prompts back and forth)
```

### AI Council: Fully Autonomous
```
Revanth: "Build the authentication system" (ONCE)
         ↓
Claude Code: 
  - Plans all sub-features
  - Decides implementation order
  - Creates database schema
  - Writes API endpoints
  - Builds frontend pages
  - Tests everything
  - Fixes any bugs
  - Documents the work
  - Tells you what to test
         ↓
Revanth: Tests once: "Works!"
         ↓
Claude Code: Moves to next major feature automatically

## 🧠 KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

### Rydon V4 Model:
```
Claude.ai (Brain) ←→ You (Messenger) ←→ Claude Code (Hands)

Problem: Knowledge stays with Claude.ai
         You're the middleman
         Claude Code only knows current task
```

### AI Council Model:
```
Claude Code (Brain + Hands)
    ↓
Bulletproof Systems (Memory)
    ↓
You (Tester + Learner)

Solution: All knowledge embedded in Claude Code
          Bulletproof systems remember everything
          You just validate and learn
```
