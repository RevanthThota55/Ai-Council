# 🚀 AI COUNCIL - QUICK START GUIDE FOR REVANTH

## What You Have Now

You have the **complete mega prompt** that will make Claude Code your autonomous project leader! This is different from Rydon V4 - Claude Code will now handle 90% of decisions on its own.

---

## 📋 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW (Next 5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Claude Code
```cmd
cd E:\Ai-Council
claude code
```

### Step 2: Copy the First Prompt

Open the file `AI-COUNCIL-MEGA-PROMPT.md` (I just created it).

Scroll to the section: **"🚦 START HERE - FIRST PROMPT"**

Copy the ENTIRE prompt starting from:
```
AUTONOMOUS PROJECT INITIALIZATION
```

All the way to:
```
Ready? Begin initialization!
```

### Step 3: Paste into Claude Code

Paste it into Claude Code and press Enter.

### Step 4: Wait for Initialization

Claude Code will now:
- Create the entire project structure
- Set up Next.js 14 + Express backend
- Build all 6 bulletproof systems
- Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- Set up database with Prisma
- Create documentation
- Run all validation tests

**This will take 10-15 minutes.** Let it work!

### Step 5: When Claude Code Says "Done"

It will tell you:
1. What it built
2. How to test it
3. What to do next
4. A simple learning note

### Step 6: Test It

Run the commands Claude Code gives you, usually:
```cmd
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to see if it works!

## 🤔 HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM RYDON?

### Rydon V4 Workflow:
```
You → Ask Claude.ai for prompt
      ↓
Claude.ai → Gives you prompt
      ↓
You → Give to Claude Code
      ↓
Claude Code → Implements
      ↓
You → Test and report back to Claude.ai
      ↓
Claude.ai → Gives next prompt
      ↓
Repeat...
```

### AI Council Workflow:
```
You → Give mega prompt ONCE to Claude Code
      ↓
Claude Code → Becomes autonomous project leader
      ↓
Claude Code → Plans entire project
      ↓
Claude Code → Implements features
      ↓
Claude Code → Tests automatically
      ↓
Claude Code → Tells you what to test
      ↓
You → Just test and say "works" or "error"
      ↓
Claude Code → Fixes or moves to next feature
      ↓
Repeat... (but Claude Code drives everything)
```

**You only interact with Claude Code now!**

## 💬 HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH CLAUDE CODE

```

**If you're confused:**
```
Can you explain this in simpler terms?
```

**If you want to see progress:**
```
Show me the progress report
```
